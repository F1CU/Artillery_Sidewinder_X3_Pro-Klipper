# Artillery Sidewinder X3 Pro - Klipper

I mostly followed the configuration for Artillery Sidewinder X3 Plus by [@TheFeralEngineer](https://github.com/TheFeralEngineer) which I adapted to work with Artillery Sidewinder X3 Pro. The method of communicating and controlling the printer using BTT-Pi and BTT-HDMI5 also comes from it. I previously used the Fujitsu Futuro S720 PC terminal for this purpose, but I liked the solution he used in his Artillery Sidewiner X3 Plus printer, but at the moment communication takes place via the USB C port because I do not currently have enough time to disassemble the printer and find method of outputting HDMI and USB cables for BTT-HDMI5.

**Printer.cfg will be available soon.
I am currently in the process of testing the configuration.**

//Update 03.04: Everything seems to be working properly. The only problem I have is probably with the END_PRINT macro (most likely the END_PRINT macro, after printing the message "Must home axis first: X Y Z [0.000]" appears.
