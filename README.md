# Artillery Sidewinder X3 Pro - Klipper

I mostly followed the configuration for Artillery Sidewinder X3 Plus by [@TheFeralEngineer](https://github.com/TheFeralEngineer) which I adapted to work with Artillery Sidewinder X3 Pro. The method of communicating and controlling the printer using BTT-Pi and BTT-HDMI5 also comes from it. I previously used the Fujitsu Futuro S720 PC terminal for this purpose, but I liked the solution he used in his Artillery Sidewiner X3 Plus printer, but at the moment communication takes place via the USB C port because I do not currently have enough time to disassemble the printer and find method of outputting HDMI and USB cables for BTT-HDMI5.

**After preliminary tests, I did not detect any problems with the operation of the printer. All functions work without problems (on Klipper I currently have a total printing time of almost 20 hours and I used almost 150 meters of Rosa3D PLA filament).**

**The entire process of switching from Marlin to Klipper in Artillery Sidewinder X3 Pro can be found at [@TheFeralEngineer](https://github.com/TheFeralEngineer), to which I cordially invite you**
